					<h2 class="sub-heading">About</h2>
					From 2011-2014, I attended Sir John A. Macdonald Collegiate Institute. For my third coop placement, I am currently looking for a coop position. The duration for this postion has to be from September 2016 to December 2016. 
					Since I reside in the North York, Ontario, I am most interested in a position in the GTA. Since I have a G license, I am comfortable driving to several locations in Ontario such as Mississauga. If you wish to schedule an interview with me, please send me an email.

				<div id="skills">
					<h2 class="sub-heading">Skills</h2>
					Here is an overview of fields I have dabbled in. <br />
					<ul>
						<li>front end web development</li>
						<li>WordPress theme development</li>
						<li>electrical panels</li>
						<li>energy</li>
					</ul>
					For WordPress, I have created my own themes from scratch. For a standard blogging site, I constructed all necessary php pages. In addition to my own
					themes, I am comfortable modifying starter themes as well. From working with Underscores, I made many deletions in the CSS, and I applied my own styling for full-width, responsive sites. 
					<br />For this site, all the HTML and CSS was written from the ground up for me. Even though this site is full-width, it lacks mobile responsiveness.
					Once I have more time, I will improve this site's responsiveness.
					<br />
					I have also done work in the Umbraco CMS. I have experimented with MVC architecture, and used XPath. I created C# classes for the model and controller.<br />
					Please visit my github, for the source code to my projects. Live previows are unavaiable there. If you request to see a live preview, please send me an email, and I will see if I can make accommadations.
